Bugs fixed in ProductScreen.


[create node server]

serves list of products to the client.

copy data from src and paste it in backend.

running this [command].
app.listen(5000,()=>{console.log("Server started at http://localhost:5000")})

After running node backend/server.js

Syntax Error:[Uncaught Reference Error]:
Code is written in ES6 version but node only understands ES5 version.
To convert from ES6 to ES5 we are going to use Babel

install packages and apply some settings:
npm install @babel/cli @babel/core @babel/node @babel/preset-env nodemon --save-dev

[nodemon] - automatically [start] and [stop] our server whenever we change our [code].

create a file in wozzby .babelrc

correction done at server.js


[How to push code in github]

1.git add .
2.git commit --message "Using useSelector"
3.git push -u origin master

[Fetch Server Data]
to get access to the server.
set a proxy in the [package.json] inside front-end folder.

go to HomeScreen and set React Hooks:

[Define a hook]:
useState() has empty value.
fetch data from Server I use useEffect.
Empty Array for component [Demount].
When all of your stuff render rendered.
fetch data from server,use Axios library.(fetch data from webAPI):
use unique for a map.[Each child in a list should have a unique "key" prop.]

//Implementing Add to Cart Feature:

//Manage State with Redux(getting list of products from a server):
Redux as a state manager.

To use redux first of all,we create a store.IN the store we have reducer.
And state.
In our view like HomeScreen,at the very beginning of our HomeScreen,we need to dispatch an action,
to list of products.[Dispatcher]
And inside the reducer,the products will be served in the State and the state will be go into the [view] to show 
the list of products.

As a first step we need to create a store.
