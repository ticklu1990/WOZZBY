[create node server]

serves list of products to the client.

copy data from src and paste it in backend.

running this [command].
app.listen(5000,()=>{console.log("Server started at http://localhost:5000")})

After running node backend/server.js

Syntax Error:[Uncaught Reference Error]:
Code is written in ES6 version but node only understands ES5 version.
To convert from ES6 to ES5 we are going to use Babel

install packages and apply some settings:
npm install @babel/cli @babel/core @babel/node @babel/preset-env nodemon --save-dev

nodemon - automatically [start] and [stop] our server whenever we change our [code].

create a file in wozzby .babelrc

correctio done at server.js
